1- What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is:
A way to write an algorithm in simple, programming-like language without being restricted to a specific language.

📌 Meaning:
Not actual code. But it illustrates the idea and steps.

2- Why and When Do We Use Pseudocode?

✨ Why?
To understand the problem before writing the code
It facilitates logical thinking
Any programmer can understand it

⏰ When Do We Use It?
Before writing the program
In exams
When explaining concepts
When designing algorithms

3- How to write pseudocode to represent an algorithm?

The method is very simple:
Write the name of the algorithm.
Define the steps in order.
Use simple keywords such as:
IF
FOR
WHILE
RETURN

📌 No programming language details required.

4- Example of a problem algorithm written in Pseudocode:
🔹Problem:
Find the sum of two numbers

🔹Pseudocode:
Algorithm Sum
Input two numbers a and b
Add a and b
Return the result
End Algorithm

🔹 Example second (a little stronger):

Problem: Countels vowels in a string
Algorithm CountVowels
Set count = 0
For each letter in string 
If the letter is a vowel 
count = count + 1
Return count
End Algorithm                                                                                      
                                                                         Task1 
Start
   Set sum to 0
   Set count to 0

   For each number in the list
       Add number to sum
       Increase count by 1
   End For

   Calculate average as sum divided by count
   Return average
End

Task2 
Start
   Input number

   If number modulo 2 equals 0 then
       Print "Even"
   Else
       Print "Odd"
   End If

End

Task3
Start
   Input list of numbers
   Set smallest to first number in the list

   For each number in the list
       If number is less than smallest then
           Set smallest to number
       End If
   End For

   Return smallest
End

Task4
Start
   Input list of numbers
   Set positiveCount to 0
   Set negativeCount to 0

   For each number in the list
       If number > 0 then
           Increase positiveCount by 1
       Else if number < 0 then
           Increase negativeCount by 1
       End If
   End For

   Return positiveCount and negativeCount
End

Task5
Start
   Input list of numbers
   Create an empty list called uniqueList

   For each number in the list
       If number is not in uniqueList then
           Add number to uniqueList
       End If
   End For

   Return uniqueList
End
 
prime number:
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. That means it has exactly two factors.

Examples of Prime Numbers:
2 (divisible by 1 and 2) ✅
3 (divisible by 1 and 3) ✅
5 (divisible by 1 and 5) ✅
7, 11, 13, 17, 19, …
Not Prime Numbers (called composite numbers):
4 (divisible by 1, 2, 4 – more than 2 factors) ❌
6 (divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6) ❌
8, 9, 10, …
Special note:
1 is not prime because it has only one factor.
2 is the only even prime number.

Task6
Start
   Input N
   Create an empty list called primeList

   For number from 2 to N
       Set isPrime to true

       For i from 2 to number - 1
           If number modulo i equals 0 then
               Set isPrime to false
               Break inner loop
           End If
       End For

       If isPrime is true then
           Add number to primeList
       End If
   End For

   Return primeList
End

Task7
Start
   Input list1
   Input list2
   Create an empty list called mergedList
   Set index1 = 0
   Set index2 = 0

   While index1 < length of list1 AND index2 < length of list2
       If list1[index1] <= list2[index2] then
           Add list1[index1] to mergedList
           Increase index1 by 1
       Else
           Add list2[index2] to mergedList
           Increase index2 by 1
       End If
   End While

   While index1 < length of list1
       Add list1[index1] to mergedList
       Increase index1 by 1
   End While

   While index2 < length of list2
       Add list2[index2] to mergedList
       Increase index2 by 1
   End While

   Return mergedList
End

Task8
Start
   Input list of numbers
   Set largest to first number in the list
   Set secondLargest to a very small number (or negative infinity)

   For each number in the list
       If number > largest then
           Set secondLargest to largest
           Set largest to number
       Else if number > secondLargest AND number < largest then
           Set secondLargest to number
       End If
   End For

   Return secondLargest
End


Palindrome or Not a Palindrome
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

Palindrome examples:
"madam" ✅
"racecar" ✅
"121" ✅
"Able was I ere I saw Elba" ✅

Not a palindrome examples:
"hello" ❌
"1234" ❌
"world" ❌

So, if something looks the same from left to right and right to left, it’s a Palindrome. Otherwise, it’s Not a Palindrome.

Task9
Start
   Input string
   Convert string to lowercase
   Remove all spaces from string
   Set reversedString to empty string

   For each character from end of string to start
       Add character to reversedString
   End For

   If string equals reversedString then
       Print "Palindrome"
   Else
       Print "Not a Palindrome"
   End If

End
