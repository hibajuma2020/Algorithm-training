1- What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is:
A way to write an algorithm in simple, programming-like language without being restricted to a specific language.

📌 Meaning:
Not actual code. But it illustrates the idea and steps.

2- Why and When Do We Use Pseudocode?

✨ Why?
To understand the problem before writing the code
It facilitates logical thinking
Any programmer can understand it

⏰ When Do We Use It?
Before writing the program
In exams
When explaining concepts
When designing algorithms

3- How to write pseudocode to represent an algorithm?

The method is very simple:
Write the name of the algorithm.
Define the steps in order.
Use simple keywords such as:
IF
FOR
WHILE
RETURN

📌 No programming language details required.

4- Example of a problem algorithm written in Pseudocode:
🔹Problem:
Find the sum of two numbers

🔹Pseudocode:
Algorithm Sum
Input two numbers a and b
Add a and b
Return the result
End Algorithm

🔹 Example second (a little stronger):

Problem: Countels vowels in a string
Algorithm CountVowels
Set count = 0
For each letter in string 
If the letter is a vowel 
count = count + 1
Return count
End Algorithm                                                                                      
                                                                         Task1 
Start
   Set sum to 0
   Set count to 0

   For each number in the list
       Add number to sum
       Increase count by 1
   End For

   Calculate average as sum divided by count
   Return average
End
